# greedy-lgn

**Backpropagation-free, layer-by-layer training of Differentiable Logic Gate Networks** — with immediate discretization, adaptive depth, and incremental logic simplification.

> Train one logic layer at a time with a local loss, discretize it, freeze it, and let the next layer learn on *real* 0/1 bits. Stop adding layers when accuracy plateaus. Simplify the circuit as it grows.

Proof-of-concept. Runs on CPU in a few minutes. A single self-contained script, no dependencies beyond `torch` and `scikit-learn`.

> **Just me playing around, not research.** I don't read papers — I bounce ideas off an AI assistant, run the experiments, and enjoy watching the accuracy points move. That's the whole thing. Nothing here is peer-reviewed, and the only "literature search" was asking the AI, so I make **no novelty or priority claims**. Plenty of these ideas probably already exist under names I don't know. Read it as a reproducible playground log, not a contribution; if it duplicates prior work, that's expected — pointers are welcome via an issue.

## Why

[Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (LGNs)](https://github.com/Felix-Petersen/difflogic) learn circuits of 2-input logic gates by relaxing gate choice to a softmax over 16 Boolean functions. They achieve extremely fast, DSP-free inference on FPGAs. But training them end-to-end with backpropagation has three known pain points:

1. **Vanishing gradients in depth.** With the standard parameterization, gradient norms fall below machine precision after ~16 logic layers ([Light DLGN, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03250)). Current fixes (residual initializations, reparameterizations) work *within* the backprop framework.
2. **The discretization gap.** Networks are trained as soft mixtures of gates and discretized afterwards; the mismatch costs accuracy and is an active research topic ([Mind the Gap, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07500)).
3. **Training memory.** Every gate holds 16 float logits, and backprop must keep the whole network soft at once.

This repo explores a different route: **remove backpropagation across layers entirely.**

## Method

```
input bits ──► [train layer 1 (soft, local GroupSum loss)]
                    │ discretize + freeze
                    ▼ hard 0/1 bits
               [train layer 2 on hard bits]
                    │ discretize + freeze
                    ▼
               ... grow until validation accuracy plateaus ...
                    │
                    ▼
               [simplify circuit: constant folding, pass-through
                removal, duplicate merge, dead-gate elimination]
```

- Each layer is trained with **its own local objective** (GroupSum + cross-entropy), in the spirit of greedy layer-wise pretraining, Cascade-Correlation (Fahlman & Lebiere, 1990) and the Forward-Forward algorithm (Hinton, 2022). No gradient ever crosses a frozen layer boundary.
- Because each frozen layer is discretized *before* the next layer trains, later layers learn on genuine Boolean inputs. **The greedy network has zero discretization gap by construction** — the reported accuracy *is* the accuracy of the final hard circuit.
- Only **one training window is ever soft**: float memory for gate logits is `gates × 16 × window` instead of `gates × 16 × depth` (default window = 1 layer).
- Depth is **not a hyperparameter**: layers are added until the hard-probe validation accuracy stops improving.
- After training, a simplification pass (constant folding → pass-through/NOT reduction → duplicate merge → dead-gate elimination) shrinks the circuit and is **verified to be bit-exact** against the original.
- Optional extensions, all off by default: `--skip-input` (re-expose input bits to every layer's wiring pool), `--window W --commit J` (train W layers ahead with backprop bounded to the window, freeze J at a time).

## The arena: 500 gates/layer, one network

Everything on the main track runs at a **fixed budget — 500 gates/layer, single network** — because the game here is watching which *ideas* move the accuracy points, not how much compute gets spent. The starting point, on `sklearn` digits (8×8, thermometer-binarized to 192 bits), CPU:

| | greedy (this repo) | end-to-end backprop |
|---|---|---|
| depth | **4 (chosen automatically)** | 4 (copied from greedy) |
| hard-circuit test accuracy | 88.2% | **93.6%** |
| discretization gap | **0 (by construction)** | 0.0 at this scale |
| float logits held during training | **8,000 (one layer)** | 32,000 (×4) |
| circuit after simplification | 2,000 → **1,316 gates (65.8%)**, bit-identical | — |

Plain local training loses ~5 pt of accuracy to backprop — in exchange for zero discretization gap, ~1/depth training memory, automatic depth, and a simplifiable circuit. From that start, the idea ladder so far (hard-circuit test accuracy, gap still structurally zero throughout):

| idea (500 gates, single net) | digits (3 seeds) | MNIST |
|---|---|---|
| plain greedy (GroupSum + CE) | 88.4% | 74.3% |
| + skip-input (`--skip-input`) | 89.1% | —¹ |
| + windowed lookahead (`--window 2 --commit 2`) | 90.4% | 76.6% |
| Forward-Forward objective (`--objective ff`) | 86.0% | 76.8% |
| FF + window | 88.0% | 78.2% |
| FF + window + hard-negative mining (`--ff-neg`) | 89.7%² | 82.0%³ |
| **residual/boosting readout (`--group-residual`)** | **96.4%** | **90.9%** |
| **residual + skip-input** | **97.3%** | **93.9%⁴** |
| **residual + skip + low-plane binarization (`--thresholds`)** | — | **94.1%⁵** |

¹ skip alone is a depth/width-synergy lever — modest at 500-gate single net, and it actively *hurts* FF, so it isn't a fixed-budget winner. ² `mix` negatives. ³ `review` + 0.5 warm-up. ⁴ at depth 38 (still slowly climbing); residual-alone 90.9% converges at depth 9. ⁵ 94.08% at depth 27 — *shallower, smaller (11,005 simplified gates vs 13,711) and faster than the control*, and the first flagship number that is **bit-exactly verified** through simplification; same-protocol control 93.82@34 (single seed, so the +0.26 pt is within possible run noise — the area/depth win is not).

**The clear winner is the residual readout.** Plain greedy throws away every layer's class prediction except the last, which is exactly why accuracy decays with depth (shallow layers see fresh image info, but their good answers are discarded). Accumulate each layer's prediction instead — plain boosting — and the decay vanishes: MNIST climbs from 74.3% to **90.9%** (single 500-gate net, no skip/window/ensemble, not overfitting: train 91.9 / test 90.6). That already matches the scaling-track flagship below (4,000 gates × 4 ensemble) at a fraction of the area. Stacking `--skip-input` on top — residual accumulates the *answer*, skip re-exposes the *image*, different cures for the same decay — compounds to **93.9%**, a new repo record, still at 500 gates single net (honest cost: depth grows 9 → 38, i.e. more latency). The readout is plain boosting / deep supervision — the observation here is just that it fixes greedy-LGN's depth decay cleanly. [→](RESULTS.md#residualboosting-readout-accumulate-the-answer-and-the-depth-decay-vanishes)

## Off the main track: scaling levers

Wider layers (`--gates`) and ensembles (`--ensemble`) buy accuracy by spending compute/area, not by being good ideas — so they live outside the arena, in **[SCALING.md](SCALING.md)** (parked reference: digits 96.4% / MNIST 90.9%). Note the residual readout above already matches that MNIST flagship as a single 500-gate net.

## All experiments (details in [RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md))

**Main track — fixed-budget ideas** (500 gates/layer, single net):

| experiment | headline | details |
|---|---|---|
| Depth stress test | e2e collapses to chance at ~12 layers (vanishing gradients); greedy still learns at layer 40 | [→](RESULTS.md#depth-stress-test-greedy-survives-40-layers-backprop-dies-at-12) |
| Skip connections (`--skip-input`) | depth finally pays: peak 88.2%@4 → 90.4%@8. DenseNet-style `--skip-all` tested, negative. (Synergizes with width — see scaling track) | [→](RESULTS.md#skip-connections-re-exposing-the-input-turns-survivable-depth-into-usable-depth) |
| Windowed lookahead (`--window`) | training 2 layers ahead closes ~⅔ of the myopia gap: 90.4% vs e2e's 91.5% (3 seeds), +2.4 pt on MNIST; overlap/receding-horizon variant loses to plain blocks | [→](RESULTS.md#windowed-lookahead-training-two-layers-ahead-closes-most-of-the-myopia-gap) |
| Forward-Forward objective (`--objective ff`) | goodness = **popcount** on binary layers, so the whole FF inference is one logic circuit; 2.4 pt behind supervised local CE on digits (86.0%) but **+2.5 pt ahead on MNIST** (76.8%) — and the first lever to exploit depth (17 layers) without skip wiring; needs label-bit replication for sparse random wiring | [→](RESULTS.md#forward-forward-objective-popcount-goodness--behind-on-digits-ahead-on-mnist) |
| FF × window, FF negative mining (`--ff-neg`) | windowed lookahead **stacks with FF** (digits 88.0%) unlike with skip; mining works once you warm up before mining (`--ff-neg review --ff-neg-warmup 0.5`): flat on digits but **MNIST 78.2% → 82.0% — the repo's best fixed-budget net**. Pure hard negatives without warm-up collapse. Structured data×label wiring (`--ff-struct`) replaces the label-replication hack at equal MNIST accuracy (tie, not a win) with a tiny pool and zero wasted gates | [→](RESULTS.md#forward-forward-objective-popcount-goodness--behind-on-digits-ahead-on-mnist) |
| Identity warm-start (`--warm-start`) | init each layer to reproduce the previous one (ResNet identity block in logic gates), then refine. **Retires the lookahead window**: on plain greedy digits, 94.5% vs the window's 90.4% (3 seeds), and keeps depth productive to 15 layers. Beats the window by ~+11 pt on MNIST too, but single-seed MNIST is noisy (~4 pt) and it stays **below the residual champion** — its value is fixing *plain* greedy, not replacing residual. `--group-boost` (AdaBoost-style reweighting on residual) is a modest +0.43 pt on MNIST | [→](RESULTS.md) |
| Adaptive per-layer epochs (`--epoch-stop` / `--epoch-chain`) | stop each layer when its gate-argmax churn settles, instead of a fixed 120. **Honest negative result**: no variant beats fixed 120 — churn half-decays at ~125 epochs, so 120 was already near-optimal. `--epoch-chain 2` ties it with 5× lower variance. Finding: fully settling a layer *stalls* depth growth (per-layer convergence isn't the goal) | [→](RESULTS.md) |
| Recursion (`--recur`, `--seq`) | weight-tied recursion — `--recur K` iterates a layer K times (parameter compression); `--seq` is RDDLGN-style temporal recurrence (one image row per step, BPTT, `s_t = L([x_t; s_{t-1}])`). Both **collapse from random init and are rescued by identity warm-start**; `--seq` on digits reaches 0.912 (3 seeds) seeing 24 bits/step. Unifying finding: recursing discrete logic needs a near-identity map pointing at *informative* bits (matches RDDLGN's Residual-init requirement). MNIST `--seq` deferred (28-step BPTT too slow interactively) | [→](RESULTS.md) |
**Upstream of the arena — preprocessing, not a learning idea**: input binarization (`--thresholds`). The diagnosis (dead bits, thresholds below quantiles) said *raise* them — the data said the opposite: quantile thresholds lose, **adding a lower plane wins** (MNIST residual 89.96 → 90.71%, 3/3 seeds, and it feeds the verified 94.08% record). A data-representation lever that transfers to any method, so it is credited separately from the method ideas. [→](RESULTS.md)

**Scaling track — reference** (width / ensembles / bigger budgets, parked):

| experiment | headline | details |
|---|---|---|
| Memory-matched width | at equal training memory (4× wider layers), greedy **beats** e2e: 95.0% vs 91.5% mean, 3 seeds | [→](SCALING.md#memory-matched-comparison-equal-training-memory-greedy-wins) |
| MNIST first pass | the pattern replicates at 45× the data: memory-matched greedy+skip 84.6% vs e2e 80.1% (absolute numbers far below difflogic-scale budgets, stated honestly) | [→](SCALING.md#mnist-the-pattern-replicates-first-pass-small-budget) |
| Ensemble voting (`--ensemble`) | parallel hard circuits + vote: stacks with everything (digits **96.4% — repo best**); on MNIST 4×500-gate members beat the single 2,000-gate best at **half the training memory**; not a substitute for direct width | [→](SCALING.md#ensemble-voting-parallel-circuits-are-the-training-memory-free-width-lever) |
| MNIST scaling | width is the dominant lever (4,000 gates: 89.8% single) and ensembling stacks: **90.9%** with 4×4,000+skip; more epochs and window×width confirmed dead (+0.1 pt each); 8,000 gates OOMs at 6 GB (pools, not eval temporaries) | [→](SCALING.md#mnist-scaling-width--ensembles-push-past-90) |

- [x] **Memory-matched comparison** — greedy wins at equal training memory ([details](SCALING.md#memory-matched-comparison-equal-training-memory-greedy-wins)).

- [ ] [Mono-Forward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09238)-style projection losses; better input binarization (fixed-budget friendly).
- [ ] *(parked, scaling track)* MNIST absolute accuracy: 8,000-gate layers (needs the pool-memory fix), FF × width/ensemble, convolutional wiring, CIFAR-10 on [difflogic](https://github.com/Felix-Petersen/difflogic) CUDA kernels.
- [ ] Simplify *between* growth steps (currently done once at the end) and rewire the next layer to the simplified circuit.
- [ ] Export simplified circuits to Verilog / run through ABC for comparison with proper logic synthesis.

## What this borrows, and what it puts together

Almost every ingredient here is from prior work — this section is about being explicit, not claiming credit. The whole repo is organized around one simple recipe:

> *Train one logic layer with a local loss, discretize it immediately, freeze it, and train the next layer on the real 0/1 bits.*

I have **not** surveyed the literature and don't claim this recipe — or any piece of it — is new; it may well exist already. What I can say concretely about each piece, without any novelty claim:

| property | where it comes from |
|---|---|
| No multipliers / DSPs / floats; maps to FPGA LUTs | **Inherited** from LGNs ([difflogic](https://github.com/Felix-Petersen/difflogic)) — not mine, just the platform. |
| **Zero discretization gap** | Follows directly from the recipe (each layer is discretized before the next trains, so the reported accuracy *is* the hard circuit's). I haven't seen this exact setup in the few LGN papers I've looked at, but I haven't searched properly — take that as ignorance, not a claim. Not "the first verified-equals-deployed network" either (exact-by-construction routes exist outside LGNs, e.g. LogicNets' truth-table enumeration). |
| Training memory = one layer, not depth | **Not special** — any greedy layer-wise scheme (Cascade-Correlation, Forward-Forward) has this. |
| Adaptive depth / grow-and-freeze | **Cascade-Correlation heritage (1990)** — old idea. One reading I liked: since circuit depth = critical-path latency, stopping at the accuracy plateau happens to give a low-latency circuit for that accuracy. Post-deployment growth is likewise possible in principle, but my own depth-stress data shows added depth only pays off with skip wiring, so treat it as hand-waving. |
| Windowed lookahead (`--window`) | **Block-wise greedy training exists** (Belilovsky et al., 2019, with auxiliary heads). What I added on top: the blocks are discretized and frozen as they're committed (bit-exact prefix preserved), depth stays adaptive, and I report the overlap ablation (commit < window) — including the negative result that overlap doesn't beat plain blocks. |

## 日本語概要

論理ゲートネットワーク(DLGN)を**逆伝播なしで1層ずつ**学習する実証実験です。各層をローカルな損失(GroupSum+交差エントロピー)で学習したら**即座に離散化して凍結**し、次の層は本物の0/1ビットの上で学習します。検証精度が頭打ちになったら層の追加を止めるため、深さは自動決定されます。学習後に回路を簡略化し、出力が完全に同一であることをビット単位で検証します。

> **論文も読まない素人がAIと壁打ちしながらのお遊びです。** AIとアイデアを出し合って、実験して、精度(ポイント)の変化を楽しんでいるだけです。査読も受けていませんし、文献調査もAIに聞いた程度なので、新規性や優先権は一切主張しません。ここにあるアイデアの多くは、私が知らない名前で既に存在しているはずです。再現できる遊びのログとして読んでください。もし既存研究と重複していたら、それが普通です — issueで教えてもらえると助かります。

本線は**500ゲート/層・単発ネットの固定予算**です。この遊びの主役は「計算資源を増やさずにアイデアだけでポイントがどれだけ動くか」で、MNISTを審判にした現在の階段は **素74.3% → 先読み窓76.6% → FF+窓+誤答復習82.0% → 残差readout(`--group-residual`)90.9% → 残差+skip 93.9% → +低側面二値化 94.1%**(単発500ゲートのリポジトリ記録。94.1%は深さ27・簡略化後11,005ゲートで、**初のビット等価検証済みの看板**です)。**明確な勝者は残差readout**です — 素のgreedyは各層の答えを捨てて最終層だけで答えるせいで深さとともに劣化しますが、各層のクラス予測を累積する(=素朴なブースティング)だけで劣化が消えます。さらに上流の入力二値化で「低い閾値の面を足す」(`--thresholds`)と残差90.0→90.7%(3シード全勝)。詳細な表は英語本文の「The arena」を参照。

**スケーリングレバー**(幅=`--gates` とアンサンブル=`--ensemble`)は別トラック(参考、[SCALING.md](SCALING.md))です。計算資源=推論回路面積を突っ込めば確実に精度を買えますが、アイデアの良し悪しは分かりません。参考値: digits 96.4%(2,000ゲート+skip+×4多数決)、MNIST 90.9%(4,000ゲート+skip+×4 soft vote)。**残差readoutは単発500ゲートでこのMNIST旗艦に並び、+skipで超えました**。このトラックは休止中です。

素のgreedyはend-to-end逆伝播に約5pt負けます(88.2% vs 93.6%)が、代わりに離散化ギャップが構造的にゼロ・学習メモリが深さ分の1・深さの自動決定という利点があります。

位置づけ: 構成要素のほとんどは先行研究からの借り物です。全体は「**各層を学習→即離散化→凍結し、次層を本物のビット上で学習する**」という素朴なレシピで組み立てられていますが、これが新しいかどうかは分かりません(ちゃんと調べていないので既出の可能性は高いです)。離散化ギャップゼロはこのレシピの帰結、メモリ効率と適応深さはCascade-Correlation / Forward-Forward由来です。詳細は英語本文の「What this borrows, and what it puts together」を参照してください。
